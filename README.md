# SAG: Shadow Art Generator - A Lotus Land Story

## An Overview
*Shadow Art Generator* is a small program that uses [Otsu's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method) to turn cartoon-style images into a [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i41KoE0iMYU) style, shadow art image. 
This is done through monochroming the foreground and the background into black and white or vice versa to recreate the signature edgy 2010 style.

## User Stories
The following list would be the main goals for Shadow Art Generator:
- As a user, I should be able to load an image and monochrome the image based on foreground and background.
- As a user, I should be able to modify some values to fine tune the product image.
- As a user, I should be able to preview the product image in the application.
- As a user, I should be able to save the product image.
